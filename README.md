I've been doing a ton of tutorials online. This is my first big project. I've done smaller things (mostly drawing on a canvas).
I guess that's all you need from a readme?
I'm not going to say that I did all of this on my own, I've already gotten a lot of help and have had to read through tons of documentation.
Let's go with a 75 25 split. Soon I would like to branch out and do some more complicated things with this game and other projects
without any assistance at all. # breakout
